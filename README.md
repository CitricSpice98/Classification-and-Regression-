# Regression-Techniques

A python Script to to evaluate the following regresion techniques on 2 datasets

The datasets -
1) a 2d Sample dataset ( sample.pickle)
2) a medical dataset “diabetes.pickle” . The input variables correspond to measurements (physical, physiological, and blood related) for a given patient and the target variable corresponds to the level of diabetic condition in the patient. It contains:
• xtrain (242 × 64) and ytrain (242 × 1) for training. • xtest (200 × 64) and ytest (200 × 1) for testing

The techniques

1) Gaussian Discrimination
2) Linear Regression
3) Ridge Regression
4) Ridge Regression With Gradient Descent
5) Non Linear Regression
